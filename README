MVC Wire is a PHP MVC Framework

Project Goals:
- Secure by default
- All user input must be validated before it can be used (Command, Headers, Post)
- Do not allow insecure features
- Unique naming convention for all sites 
- DRY (Don't repeat yourself)
- Templatized views 
- Easy and required regular expression input validation on both client and server side
- All forms tokenized for CSRF
- All input filtered for XSS and SQLi
- Easy rendering for multiple targets based on capabilities (HTML5, Mobile, etc)
- Consistently apply the principle of least priviledge
- Zero database code, Model Classes will create their own database schema and crud operations for persistance
